            This variation is a line graph showing the percentage of "Yes" responses over time to the corresponding
            question category selected. My aim with the color choices was to leverage the colors we are familiar with
             respect to America. This iteration is the same as the previous in that there is a linear interpolation between points.
            However, I've added dots at each data point for two reasons. First is that this may more clearly show where in time
            each poll was taken. Secondly is for future considerations, we may annotate certain points/dots with corresponding
            events that took place in that time frame.
